# Wordle

[Play the Demo](https://wordle-game.herokuapp.com/)

Guess the word in 6 tries. Each guess must be a valid 5 letter word. Hit the enter button to submit.

After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.

A green letter is in the word and in the correct spot, a yellow letter is in the word but in the wrong spot and a dark gray letter is not in the word in any spot.

## About

I was inspired by the popular game [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) and I wanted to create a new project in Vue 3 using the composition API for the first time. This is still a work in progress, but it's playable.

## Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Run development server
$ npm run dev
```
